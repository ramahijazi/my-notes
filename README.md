#### **27** years old, I’m electrical engineering working as freelancer in my field specifically lighting design,now in my work I need to learn ui/ux because in my field I’m supplier part from our system and we need to reach more customers than we need to have own app and web in full security

#### The summary of the paragraphs is that all developers face problems and there is a solution to every problem if we start looking for solutions

First of all, you should understand the purpose of the software. There is, in fact, a single purpose of all software: **To help people**, When you are making decisions about software, you should guide yourself by always keeping this in mind: How we can help? You can even prioritize feature requests this way. Every programmer is a designer, that’s mean the design needs to be programmed, The design of software aims to make developers job as easy as possible so they can focus on what matters. You will create software that will help users and your software will continue to help them for a long time.
However, if you design a bad system, your software’s lifetime will be short. To design systems that can be created and maintained as easily as possible by their developers, so that they can be — and continue to be — as helpful as possible. Then Understanding is the key difference between a bad developer and a good developer, The truth is that if other developers who read your code can understand it easily it means that you are doing good.
Controlling complexity is the essence of computer programming. The source of many software failures is complexity. You start out with a simple project that can be completed in one month. Then you add complexity, and the task will take up to three months. Then you start to add features that fulfill some other purpose. Things get very complex because you expand your software purpose for no reason. The tasks will take six months.
Maintenance is one of the most important things in software development. All changes require maintenance. Consistency is a big part of simplicity. If you do something one way in one place, do it that way in every place. For example, if you name a variable thisIsVariable, then all of your variables should be named that way (otherVariable, anAnotherVariable, etc. not other_variable).
